        ### Quick Recap of Metrics:

        **Mean Squared Error (MSE):**

        - MSE measures the average squared difference between the predicted values and the actual values (the target values).
        - It quantifies the overall quality of the model's predictions, with **lower values indicating a better fit**.

        **R-squared (R2) Score**:

        - R-squared is a measure of **how well the independent variables (features) explain the variance** in the dependent variable (target).
        - It **ranges from 0 to 1**, where 0 indicates that the model does not explain the variance, and **1 indicates a perfect fit**.

        **Explained Variance Score:**

        - The Explained Variance Score is similar to R2 and measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variables.
        - Like R2, it also **ranges from 0 to 1**, with **higher values indicating better explanatory power**.

        **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):**

        - MAE measures the average absolute difference between the predicted values and the actual values.
        - It provides a measure of the model's accuracy, with **lower values indicating better accuracy**.

    # Overview
    - This is a web application of a model trained using [average car prices - Brazil](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vagnerbessa/average-car-prices-bazil) for average brazillian car prices.
    - The model was trained on fipe_data for the year of 2022.
    - For a detailed understanding of the data mining process, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the implementation of the model, please refer to the [project repository](link here).
